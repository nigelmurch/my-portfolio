    <h3>Why I Became a UX Researcher</h3>
    <p>I’m a UX researcher and service designer shaped by hardship, hope, and relentless belief in people.</p>
    <p>I was a kid of the ’80s, glued to a computer while the outside world made less and less sense. I didn’t fit in. I was bullied constantly, and by 4th form (Year 10), I left school for good. Not because I didn’t care — but because no one seemed to care about how I learned or who I was.

So I worked. I worked on farms. I joined forestry fire crews. I became a butcher. I served in the Territorial Army. I cleaned schools and buildings for Spotless Services (then P&O). But in 1997, while helping fasten a chain around a log, a leading hand told a driver to move forward before I was clear. The tractor crushed my right hand.

I carried on — taking a job at PPCS Waitane and eventually becoming a boner at Alliance Group Lorneville. Then came 2002, and the back injury that would unravel the life I’d worked for. For years, I was misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The medications, the endless hospital visits, the confusion — it wore me down. It wasn’t until 2016 that the ISS Clinic in Dunedin correctly diagnosed me with Functional Neurological Disorder.

Pain, disconnection, grief — they defined those years. But through it all, gaming became my escape. Locked in virtual worlds, I wasn’t broken. I wasn’t in pain. I wasn’t limited. I was free. I was part of something. I told people: “I’m living stories I can’t experience otherwise.” And slowly, I realized I wasn’t just playing — I was analysing. I began seeing what worked and what didn’t in the experience. That ember of curiosity from my childhood returned.

In 2012, I earned diplomas in Digital Film and Digital Photography. But Work and Income said I was “unfit for work,” so I wasn’t allowed to continue studying. So I waited. And I watched my daughter Tammi rise — becoming a fully qualified chef through S.I.T. She told me, “Don’t give up, Dad. It’s not over for you.”

But then came the darkest chapter. In 2021, just after the major COVID lockdowns, Tammi was in a tragic car accident. At her hospital bedside, as her life slipped away, I made her a promise:

“I will study again. I will never give up.”

In February 2023, I was finally approved to study. I chose the best: Media Design School. Not just for the reputation — but because I needed to channel everything I’d lived through into something that mattered.

As a UX researcher, I bring more than method — I bring manaaki. I listen deeply, I advocate fiercely, and I design for those left behind by systems and assumptions. My life — the pain, the passion, the promise — shaped me to understand what others overlook.

This isn’t a job. It’s a purpose born from hardship, lit by love, and kept alive by the memory of my daughter’s belief in me.
