        <h3>Nigel Murch — UX Researcher & Service Designer</h3>

        <p>Kia ora, I’m Nigel Murch — a UX researcher dedicated to uncovering what people truly need, especially in spaces where silence, stigma, or systems make access unfair.</p>
        <p>Over the past three years, while studying at <span class="highlight">Media Design School</span> in <span class="highlight">Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland)</span>, Aotearoa New Zealand, I'm driven by a singular purpose:</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">To uncover and understand what people truly need</span> — especially in spaces where <span class="highlight">silence, stigma, or systemic barriers</span> have made access unjustifiably difficult.</p>
        <p>I see UX not just as a profession, but as a <span class="highlight">vehicle for creating a fairer, more compassionate world</span>.</p>

        <p>My work is guided by three core principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="highlight">Understand deeply</span></li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Design with purpose</span></li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Always advocate for the user</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>As a UX researcher and service designer, I navigate the deeply human side of design — looking beyond surface-level data to discover the <span class="highlight">emotional, cultural, and systemic layers</span> that influence how people experience services.</p>
        <p>Whether I’m <span class="highlight">co-designing with communities</span>, <span class="highlight">interviewing rangatahi</span>, or <span class="highlight">testing early prototypes</span>, my purpose remains constant — to amplify marginalised voices, bridge access gaps, and champion inclusive, ethical innovation.</p>

        <p>My practice is shaped by a life steeped in <span class="highlight">storytelling, deep listening, and collaborative change-making</span>.</p>
        <p>I come from the <span class="highlight">Rural South West of Te Waipounamu</span> (South Island), and because of my lived experiences, my values are firmly rooted in <span class="highlight">service, curiosity, and integrity</span>.</p>

        <p>I believe that when we approach design with <span class="highlight">empathy</span> and respect people as the <span class="highlight">experts of their own lived experiences</span>, we elevate design from functional to transformational.</p>
        <p>I’m passionate about <span class="highlight">global equity and access</span>, from <span class="highlight">sexual health</span> to <span class="highlight">digital inclusion</span>. There are no excuses for excluding or discriminating against anyone for any reason.</p>

        <p>I strive to challenge <span class="highlight">manipulative design and harmful defaults</span> by promoting <span class="highlight">transparency</span>, <span class="highlight">cultural insight</span>, and <span class="highlight">co-design</span>.</p>
        <p>My design philosophy is also grounded in <span class="highlight">environmental responsibility</span>, believing that digital experiences should be <span class="highlight">intuitive, inclusive, and sustainable</span>.</p>

        <p>My <span class="highlight">research-led approach</span> transforms complexity into clarity, crafting interactions that feel <span class="highlight">effortless, respectful, and genuinely useful</span>.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I’m committed to contributing to <span class="highlight">bold, community-led projects that uplift lives</span>, whether in healthcare, housing, public services, or digital platforms.</p>
        <p>I want to continue supporting organisations in <span class="highlight">transforming meaningful insight into real-world impact</span>.</p>

        <p>I myself have been in the systems of <span class="highlight">health and welfare</span>, navigating life with a <span class="highlight">spinal injury</span> that altered my world forever...</p>

        <p><strong>This portfolio is more than a collection of work</strong>.<br>
        It’s a reflection of who I am as a designer and a person — someone who believes in <span class="highlight">equity, ethics, and the power of listening</span>. Someone who shows up with purpose and walks alongside others to <span class="highlight">build better, together</span>.</p>
