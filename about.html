  <p><strong>Why I Became a UX Researcher — and Why I’ll Never Stop</strong></p>
  <p>I’m a UX researcher and designer shaped by hardship, hope, and a relentless belief in people.</p>
  <p>My journey into UX didn’t begin in a classroom. It began in the paddocks of Southland, in meatworks and firelines, in hospital wards and Work and Income offices. It began in the quiet moments of feeling invisible — and in the louder ones, where I refused to be.</p>
  <p>I grew up in the 1980s obsessed with computers — fascinated by how they connected people to new worlds. But school was brutal. I left in Year 10, not because I wanted to, but because I had to. What followed was a life of hard labour, injury, and misdiagnosis. For ten years, I lived under the shadow of a condition I didn’t have, while the real one — Functional Neurological Disorder — went undetected. I felt erased.</p>
  <p>But in the darkest moments, I found light in unexpected places. In video games, I found freedom. In storytelling, I found meaning. And in my daughter Tammi, I found purpose. When she passed away in 2021, I made a promise at her bedside: I will study again. I will make this life count.</p>
  <p>That promise led me to Media Design School, where I began to shape a new path — one rooted in empathy, equity, and design. Today, I’m a UX specialist who asks meaningful questions, listens deeply, and co-creates experiences that support people in real, tangible ways.</p>
  <p>My work is human-centred and purpose-driven. I believe people are the experts of their own lives, and my role is to listen, translate, and connect — turning lived experience into actionable insight. I’ve worked alongside Māori communities, eco-conscious groups, and rangatahi navigating stigma in healthcare. These collaborations have taught me that design has the most power where silence, shame, or systems have failed.</p>
  <p>One project I’m proud of is <em>Kōtuitui Toi HealthCare</em>, a sexual health initiative for young people in Aotearoa. Through inclusive research and co-design, we created a mobile service that met rangatahi where they were — with testing kits, soundproof booths, and vibrant, youth-led visuals. It wasn’t just design. It was dignity.</p>
  <p>Another project explored how storytelling could help communities embrace wild and invasive species as sustainable food sources — blending environmental care with cultural values and behavioural insight.</p>
  <p>At the heart of everything I do are three principles:</p>
