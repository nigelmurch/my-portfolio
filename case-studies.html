    <h2>Case Study 1: Wild Boar to the Rescue</h2>
    <p>
      In southern Italy, wild boar populations have exploded due to climate change and habitat loss. Local foraging groups and chefs have teamed up to harvest wild boar sustainably, turning them into nutritious meals distributed through food banks. This approach not only reduces crop damage and road accidents, but also provides iron-rich protein to vulnerable communities. Controlled harvesting is helping rebalance ecosystems and redirecting meat costs to where it's needed most.

    <h2>Case Study 2: Invasive Plants Feeding Aotearoa</h2>
    <p>
      In New Zealand, invasive plants like gorse and wild fennel are seen as threats to native biodiversity. But for community kitchens like "Kai for All" in Wellington, these weeds have become sources of sustenance. Volunteers forage invasive greens for use in pestos, teas, and soups. This initiative educates communities on edible ecology while helping fight food insecurity. It’s a small-scale circular economy that feeds people and protects the whenua.
