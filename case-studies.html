    Above image is courtesy of Adobe stock https://stock.adobe.com <br>southern Italy, wild boar populations have exploded due to climate change and habitat loss. Local foraging groups and chefs have teamed up to harvest wild boar sustainably, turning them into nutritious meals distributed through food banks. This approach not only reduces crop damage and road accidents, but also provides iron-rich protein to vulnerable communities. Controlled harvesting is helping rebalance ecosystems and redirecting meat costs to where it's needed most.

  <h2>Case Study 2: Invasive Plants Feeding Aotearoa</h2>
  <img src="images/rosehip jelly.png" alt="Wild Boar" class="case-image" />  
    <p>
      In New Zealand, invasive plants like gorse and wild fennel are seen as threats to native biodiversity. But for community kitchens like "Kai for All" in Wellington, these weeds have become sources of sustenance. Volunteers forage invasive greens for use in pestos, teas, and soups. This initiative educates communities on edible ecology while helping fight food insecurity. It’s a small-scale circular economy that feeds people and protects the whenua.

 <h2>Case Study 3: Flavours By Papatūānuku</h2>
    <p>Turning Wild and Invasive Species into Eco-Conscious Delicacies.</p><br> <br> <h3>The Mission </h3> <br> <p>Help eco-conscious Kiwis rethink what’s edible by showcasing the flavour potential of wild and invasive species—while restoring balance to Aotearoa’s ecosystem. This wasn’t just about food. It was about reframing perception, reducing carbon footprints, and sparking a movement of adventurous, sustainable eaters.</p><br><br>
<h3>My Role</h3>
	<p>•	Lead Service Designer & Researcher</p><br>
	<p>•	UX & Content Designer for the website</p><br>
	<p>•	Collaborator with Whānau & Community</p>
<br><br> <h3>Research Power-Up </h3><br>
<div class="case-study">
  <p>Through interviews, surveys, and usability testing with foragers and everyday people, I uncovered key insights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Neophobia (fear of unfamiliar foods) was a massive barrier</li>
    <li>Eco-conscious people were eager to help but didn’t know how</li>
    <li>People trusted other people’s experiences more than facts or stats</li>
    <li>It wasn’t just about taste—it was about purposeful eating</li>
  </ul>
</div>
 <h3>Enter: Flavours by Papatūānuku</h3>
<p>A bold retro website blending education, storytelling, and action. It features:</p>
<div class="case-study">
  <h3>Key User Paths:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Curious Consumers – “What can I forage near me?”</li>
    <li>Eco-Food Explorers – “How do I cook this?”</li>
    <li>Changemakers – “How do I inspire others?”</li>
  </ul>

</div>

<h3> Identity:</h3>
<p>Earthy colour palette and practical appearence, symbolising “care and focus on whats important” in climate action. <br><br>Real Stories:
User-generated tasting tales from rangatahi, whānau, and eco-warriors help break down the fear of trying something new. <br><br>Experiments:
One example? My wild pork cured with whiskey and mānuka honey—tested on 15 participants with 100% saying they’d eat it again!</P> <br><br>
<h3> from the Field</h3>
<p>“I thought it’d taste weird. Turns out—it’s better than supermarket ham!”
“I finally get why eating invasive species helps the land. That’s genius.”
“The retro vibe makes it feel fun, not preachy.”</p> <br><br>
<h3>Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Increased interest from local foraging groups and food educators</li>
  <li>Workshop invite from sustainable living collectives</li>
  <li>Supported a values-based conversation about kai sovereignty and kaitiakitanga</li>
  <li>Created a platform where people don’t just read—they act</li>
</ul>

<h3>I Learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Design is a bridge—between knowledge and action, taste and tradition</li>
  <li>Cultural narratives matter—Te Ao Māori values must lead, not follow</li>
  <li>People follow people—real stories &gt; polished marketing</li>
</ul>
<h3> Future Goals for Flavours By Papatūānuku</h3>
  <p>My future goal 1: I’m planning to be working on interactive maps, forager profiles, and a give back page to help those in need.
My future goal 2: bring the experience into classrooms and communities.</p><br><br>
<h3> to Action</h3>
<p> Forage with care. Eat with Purpose. Restore Balance.
Flavours by Papatūānuku is just getting started—and everyone has a role to play.</p>
