      <h3>🌿 Gorse & Goats in Aotearoa</h3>
      <p>Gorse was brought to New Zealand in the 1800s and quickly became an invasive nightmare. However, it can be turned into opportunity. Conservation trials have shown that feral goats can reduce gorse cover by over 90% in a year. With proper management, these goats can be harvested as food for whānau facing food insecurity.</p>
      <p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Native ecosystems regenerate in gorse-cleared areas.</p>
      <p><strong>Social Benefit:</strong> Goats become a source of meat for food-insecure communities.</p>

      <h3>🐟 Asian Carp to “Copi” in the USA</h3>
      <p>Asian carp invaded U.S. waterways, outcompeting native fish. To fight this, Illinois rebranded it as “Copi” — a healthy, affordable protein. It’s now appearing in ceviche and burgers at restaurants across Chicago. Meanwhile, state programs are donating carp-based meals to hunger relief groups.</p>
      <p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Removal of carp restores river biodiversity.</p>
      <p><strong>Social Benefit:</strong> Copi is nutritious and feeds underserved communities.</p>
