      <h3>Case Study One: The Brooklyn Urban Hunt</h3>
      <p>In Brooklyn, local nonprofits partner with food banks to serve dishes made from wild invaders like the feral pig and garlic mustard. This initiative provides protein-rich meals to those in need while also managing ecosystem damage caused by overpopulation of these species. It promotes food sovereignty and engages marginalized communities in ecological action.</p>

      <h3>Case Study Two: Australia’s Wild Harvest Initiative</h3>
      <p>Australian communities have embraced kangaroo, camel, and carp meat in school lunch programs and shelters. These invasive species damage land and water ecosystems, and consuming them redirects food waste and supports low-income populations. Educational campaigns have helped shift public perception from pest to valuable resource.</p>
