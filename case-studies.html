    <h2>Wild Boar to the Rescue</h2>
    <p>
      After digging into the data and real-world examples, I’m struck by how wild boar foraging—and even controlled harvesting—can shift from problem to potential. In southern Italy, dense boar populations are uprooting forest floors, flipping soil and seedlings like natural tillers—impacting everything from oak regeneration to rare butterflies. That same digging can also reshape ecosystems: turning over 2–4 m² of soil a day, helping aerate soils, seed dispersal, and habitat renewal.<br><br>
      But here’s the kicker: I found evidence that communities are taking this wild ecology into their own hands. In Apulia (Puglia), public vets and hunting groups are trialling models to harvest boar meat, tested and safe, to both protect agriculture and create sustainable food chains. It’s not just culling—it’s reframing the narrative. Especially when well-coordinated harvesting conserves local food systems, curbs crop damage, and mitigates disease risk, like African swine fever, through veterinary oversight.<br><br>
      In my view, this isn’t about glorifying wild boar, it’s about transforming an ecological challenge into a community opportunity. It blends environmental stewardship, circular economic thinking, and social equity—all through design and systems. That’s the kind of thinking I want to bring into my work.

    <h2>Invasive Plants Feeding Aotearoa</h2>
    <p>
      In Aotearoa, invasive plants like gorse, blackberry, and wild fennel are often seen as pests. But local community groups are flipping the script—turning these once-problematic weeds into jam, syrup, herbal blends, and teas.<br><br>
      This project isn’t just about culinary creativity—it’s grounded in community resilience, climate action, and food sovereignty. By involving rangatahi, kuia, and whānau in harvesting and recipe making, the movement empowers knowledge sharing and reconnects people to whenua.<br><br>
      The initiative also diverts food waste, raises awareness about biodiversity threats, and promotes a uniquely New Zealand approach to invasive management through kai. A delicious, sustainable act of rebellion.

    <h2>Flavours By Papatūānuku</h2>
    <p>
      Flavours By Papatūānuku is a platform designed to inspire, inform, and activate eco-conscious food behaviours. By focusing on invasive and native wild kai, it aims to shift mindsets and reduce the environmental impacts of conventional agriculture.<br><br>
      I developed the brand identity to reflect grounded climate values—earthy colours, bold messages, and retro flair. The storytelling strategy elevates real voices and community tasting experiments: like my cured wild pork with whiskey and mānuka honey, tested on 15 participants—all of whom said they’d eat it again!<br><br>
      The site offers recipes, flavour profiles, and foraging guidance to help people connect with the land through kai. It’s food design with a conscience.
