  <h2>Eat wild. Protect nature. Share kai.</h2>

  <h3>Service Design Purpose</h3>
  <p><strong>Flavours By Papatūānuku</strong> is an eco-conscious food design service that connects people to wild and invasive foods—like goat, rabbit, and deer—as a way to nourish communities, reduce food costs, and protect native ecosystems through ethical eating.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong> Environmental Guardianship (Kaitiakitanga):</strong> Eating invasive species helps restore balance to Aotearoa's environment and reduces reliance on imported foods.</li>
    <li><strong> Community Nourishment (Manaakitanga):</strong> The service supports those suffering under the weight of rising food costs by offering alternative, nutritious kai.</li>
    <li><strong> Regenerative Mindset:</strong> Instead of just eradicating pests, it reimagines them as part of a restorative, circular food system.</li>
    <li><strong> Food Culture Shift:</strong> Retro visuals help reduce food neophobia and spark curiosity around future foods.</li>
    <li><strong> Indigenous-Led Values:</strong> Grounded in decolonisation, whanaungatanga, and respect for Papatūānuku.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The result is a playful, provocative, and practical way to shift food culture toward sustainability and equity in Aotearoa.</p>
</div>

 <div class="detail-box">
  <h3>Design Insight</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Flavours By Papatūānuku</strong> is rooted in the idea that changing how people think about food requires more than just facts—it requires culture, emotion, and identity.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Psychology of Eating:</strong> Many people avoid wild or unfamiliar foods not because of taste, but because of <em>food neophobia</em>—a fear learned in childhood. This insight shaped the design to gently challenge fear with curiosity and play.</li>
    <li><strong> Decolonisation Through Kai:</strong> The project uses kai as a tool for decolonisation—reframing what’s “good” to eat, valuing traditional food systems, and honoring indigenous ways of living with the land.</li>
    <li><strong> Eco-Friendly Framing:</strong> Presenting wild kai as a climate-conscious choice empowers users to feel like guardians (kaitiaki) of Aotearoa when they eat sustainably.</li>
    <li><strong>Designed for Connection:</strong> Everything—tone, visuals, storytelling—is designed to create feelings of whanaungatanga (relationship and kinship), so users feel part of a wider movement of care.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This insight-driven approach transforms the act of eating into an opportunity to reconnect—with nature, culture, and each other.

      <h3>What is F.B.P?</h3>
      <p>
        A research-led food design concept encouraging New Zealanders to eat wild, invasive species 
        like deer, goat, and rabbit — not just to reduce their food costs, but to help heal the ecosystem.
      </p>
    </div>

   <div class="detail-box">  
     <div class="work-card">
      <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
      <p>
        Eco-conscious families, hunters, foragers, foodies, and anyone passionate about sustainability 
        and challenging food neophobia. Especially those struggling with rising costs of living.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="detail-box">
      <h3>Why Retro Design?</h3>
      <p>
        To engage users emotionally and visually, using a familiar visual language from old-school 
        games and early web nostalgia — perfect for challenging the way we see "future food."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="detail-box">
      <h3>Where to Next?</h3>
      <p>
        Future development includes an interactive recipe book, a forager’s AR guide, and partnerships 
        with iwi and conservation groups to source and cook invasive species ethically and legally.
