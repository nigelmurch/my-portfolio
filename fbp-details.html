      <h3>Service Design Purpose</h3>
      <p><strong>Flavours By Papatūānuku</strong> Flavours by Papatūānuku is more than a food initiative.I see it as a compilation of the below key points</p> <Br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kaitiakitanga:</strong> Eating invasive species helps restore balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Manaakitanga:</strong> Support those experiencing food hardship through the current cost of living crisis.</li>
        <li><strong>Regenerative Mindset:</strong> Reframe pests as resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Food Culture Shift:</strong> Retro visuals encourage curiosity.</li>
        <li><strong>Indigenous-Led:</strong> Centered in decolonisation and whakapapa.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
       <p>Flavours By Papatūānuku must be visualised as a movement rooted in aroha (love), kaitiakitanga (guardianship), and whanaungatanga (connection). It seeks to transform the way people in Aotearoa think about food, nature, and belonging.
At its heart, this service was designed to reconnect people with the whenua (land) by offering an eco-conscious food solution that heals both our ecosystems and our communities. By reframing invasive species as a source of nourishment rather than destruction, Flavours by Papatūānuku addresses the intersecting challenges of environmental degradation, food insecurity, and cultural disconnection.
This kaupapa (mission) grew from deeply held values: that food is more than fuel—it’s identity, memory, and mana. We understand that real change doesn’t come from fear or guilt, but from curiosity, courage, and joy. Through playful retro design, honest storytelling, and immersive tasting experiences, the service gently challenges food neophobia and encourages a cultural shift in how we view what’s edible, what’s valuable, and what’s possible.
Guided by indigenous knowledge systems and shaped through co-design with eco-conscious families, foragers, and food justice advocates, the service offers practical, scalable solutions. These include recipes, foraging guides, storytelling media, and educational resources—all designed to foster pride, resilience, and collective action.
In a world overwhelmed by fast consumption and climate crisis, Flavours by Papatūānuku invites us to slow down, look closer, and reimagine a future where eating can be an act of restoration, not just of land, but of identity, dignity, and community.
This is not just a service—it’s a wero (challenge) to remember who we are, where we come from, and how we care for the world that feeds us.</p>

      <h3>>Project Rationale Report</h3>
      <p><strong>We are in an era marked by climate uncertainty</strong> cultural disconnection, and growing economic inequality. Design has a vital role to play in reimagining more sustainable and equitable futures. I chose to undertake the Flavours by Papatūānuku project not only as a creative and academic challenge, but as a deeply personal and values-driven response to urgent issues facing Aotearoa New Zealand.</p> <Br>
      <p>This service design project is built on a simple but powerful premise: What if we could turn an ecological crisis—our growing population of invasive species—into an opportunity for nourishment, education, and reconnection? What if design could help people feel proud, rather than fearful, of embracing unfamiliar or “wild” foods? What if Kai could help heal both land and people?</p> <br>
        <h6>Personal Connection and Cultural Responsibility</h6>
      <p>As someone who is on a journey of cultural rediscovery, with connections to Ngāti Maniapoto, I have felt the importance of using design as a way to honour whakapapa and uphold mana motuhake (self-determination). This project allowed me to explore design not just as a tool for problem-solving, but as a medium for storytelling, transformation, and cultural empowerment.
In designing Flavours by Papatūānuku, I wanted to embrace values rooted in mātauranga Māori—such as kaitiakitanga, manaakitanga, and whanaungatanga—and weave them into a service that is as practical as it is poetic. I wanted to create something that could invite people to not only try new foods, but to reconsider their relationship with the whenua and their role as guardians of it.
<br>
        <h6>Designing for Change, Not Just Awareness</h6>
<p>What drew me to this kaupapa was the challenge of behaviour change. I learned through research that many people reject wild or invasive foods not because of taste or safety, but because of a deeply ingrained food neophobia—a fear often learned in childhood or reinforced by social norms. Rather than using fear-based messaging or facts alone, I wanted to take a more human, playful, and empathetic approach—one that gently challenges assumptions and invites curiosity. This project also aligned with my growing interest in systems thinking and circular design. Instead of framing invasive species purely as a pest problem, Flavours by Papatūānuku reframes them as potential resources, bringing together environmental action, economic resilience, and culinary innovation.</p>
      <br>
      <h6>A Unique Design Challenge</h6>
     <p>Designing this service was not easy. It required navigating the tension between provocation and accessibility, between traditional knowledge and modern tools. It demanded sensitivity in language, tone, and representation. It also challenged me to step outside my comfort zone—to experiment with storytelling, speculative design, food psychology, and retro visual language, all while grounding the work in rigorous research and planning future co-design.
But these challenges are exactly why I chose the project. I wanted to stretch myself. I wanted to work on something that mattered.</p> 
<br>
<h6>To Conclude</h6>
      <p> I chose Flavours by Papatūānuku because it represents the kind of design I believe in—design that is grounded in people, place, and purpose. It is a service that speaks to the heart of sustainability, indigeneity, and community. It offers a way to nourish not just bellies, but minds and relationships. Most importantly, it is a challenge to rethink the systems we’ve inherited, and to prototype a future we’d be proud to pass on.

In taking on this unique project, I have not only grown as a designer, but I have also grown in conviction, clarity, and cultural connection. I would do it again in a heartbeat.</p>
