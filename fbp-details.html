      <h3>Service Design Purpose</h3>
      <p><strong>Flavours By Papatūānuku</strong> Flavours by Papatūānuku is more than a food initiative.I see it as a compilation of the below key points</p> <Br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Kaitiakitanga:</strong> Eating invasive species helps restore balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Manaakitanga:</strong> Support those experiencing food hardship through the current cost of living crisis.</li>
        <li><strong>Regenerative Mindset:</strong> Reframe pests as resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Food Culture Shift:</strong> Retro visuals encourage curiosity.</li>
        <li><strong>Indigenous-Led:</strong> Centered in decolonisation and whakapapa.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Flavours ByPapatūānuku must be visualised as a movement rooted in aroha (love), kaitiakitanga (guardianship), and whanaungatanga (connection). It seeks to transform the way people in Aotearoa think about food, nature, and belonging.
At its heart, this service was designed to reconnect people with the whenua (land) by offering an eco-conscious food solution that heals both our ecosystems and our communities. By reframing invasive species as a source of nourishment rather than destruction, Flavours by Papatūānuku addresses the intersecting challenges of environmental degradation, food insecurity, and cultural disconnection.
This kaupapa (mission) grew from deeply held values: that food is more than fuel—it’s identity, memory, and mana. We understand that real change doesn’t come from fear or guilt, but from curiosity, courage, and joy. Through playful retro design, honest storytelling, and immersive tasting experiences, the service gently challenges food neophobia and encourages a cultural shift in how we view what’s edible, what’s valuable, and what’s possible.
Guided by indigenous knowledge systems and shaped through co-design with eco-conscious families, foragers, and food justice advocates, the service offers practical, scalable solutions. These include recipes, foraging guides, storytelling media, and educational resources—all designed to foster pride, resilience, and collective action.
In a world overwhelmed by fast consumption and climate crisis, Flavours by Papatūānuku invites us to slow down, look closer, and reimagine a future where eating can be an act of restoration—not just of land, but of identity, dignity, and community.
This is not just a service—it’s a wero (challenge) to remember who we are, where we come from, and how we care for the world that feeds us.</p>
