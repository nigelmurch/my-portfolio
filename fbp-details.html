  <h3>Service Design Purpose</h3>
  <p><strong>Flavours By Papatūānuku</strong> is an eco-conscious food design service that connects people to wild and invasive foods—like goat, rabbit, and deer—as a way to nourish communities, reduce food costs, and protect native ecosystems through ethical eating.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong> Environmental Guardianship (Kaitiakitanga):</strong> Eating invasive species helps restore balance to Aotearoa's environment and reduces reliance on imported foods.</li>
    <li><strong> Community Nourishment (Manaakitanga):</strong> The service supports those suffering under the weight of rising food costs by offering alternative, nutritious kai.</li>
    <li><strong> Regenerative Mindset:</strong> Instead of just eradicating pests, it reimagines them as part of a restorative, circular food system.</li>
    <li><strong> Food Culture Shift:</strong> Retro visuals help reduce food neophobia and spark curiosity around future foods.</li>
    <li><strong> Indigenous-Led Values:</strong> Grounded in decolonisation, whanaungatanga, and respect for Papatūānuku.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The result is a playful, provocative, and practical way to shift food culture toward sustainability and equity in Aotearoa.</p>

  <div class="detail-box">
    <h3>Design Insight</h3>
    <p>This project is grounded in decolonisation, sustainability, and whanaungatanga. It aims to normalize consumption of wild kai as an act of kaitiakitanga and manaakitanga.</p>

      <h3>What is F.B.P?</h3>
      <p>
        A research-led food design concept encouraging New Zealanders to eat wild, invasive species 
        like deer, goat, and rabbit — not just to reduce their food costs, but to help heal the ecosystem.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="work-card">
      <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
      <p>
        Eco-conscious families, hunters, foragers, foodies, and anyone passionate about sustainability 
        and challenging food neophobia. Especially those struggling with rising costs of living.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="work-card">
      <h3>Why Retro Design?</h3>
      <p>
        To engage users emotionally and visually, using a familiar visual language from old-school 
        games and early web nostalgia — perfect for challenging the way we see "future food."
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="work-card">
      <h3>Where to Next?</h3>
      <p>
        Future development includes an interactive recipe book, a forager’s AR guide, and partnerships 
        with iwi and conservation groups to source and cook invasive species ethically and legally.
