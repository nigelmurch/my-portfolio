  <h2>What Went Right</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Strong Conceptual Foundation</strong><br>
    The core idea of accessibility and inclusion through the symbol of a “door” was strong, universal, and relatable. It resonated with people from a range of backgrounds and allowed us to ground the design in real social impact.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Team Collaboration & Contribution</strong><br>
    Our team operated with a genuine heart. Everyone brought something unique to the table, whether that was visual design, research, storytelling, or cultural insight.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lo-fi to Hi-fi Progression</strong><br>
    The design process moved well through paper prototypes, lo-fi sketches, and toward a more developed visual language. We were able to test layouts and flows, getting a clearer sense of how the experience would function in real life.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Clarity of Visual Purpose</strong><br>
    While the concept was strong, there were moments where the visuals didn’t fully match the emotional weight of the story we were trying to tell. Some early designs lacked cohesion, and our symbolism didn’t always translate clearly to viewers.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Limited Iteration Time</strong><br>
    Due to time constraints, some elements of the project were rushed. The refinement stage — where we could have polished animations, interactions, or typographic hierarchy — felt a bit squeezed, in my opinion. This meant we didn’t fully realise the depth and clarity that the project deserved.
    </li>
    <li><strong>User Testing Gaps</strong><br>
    We didn’t conduct as much real-world or community-based user testing as we should have. This limited our ability to validate key design decisions and understand how they might work, and might land with actual users who face the issues we were addressing.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Content Planning</strong><br>
    There were inconsistencies or vagueness around some messaging, including what the “Open Door” offered practically versus symbolically. If we had aligned on tone, message hierarchy, and audience from the beginning, the design could have carried more clarity and impact.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Group Presence and Communication</strong><br>
    All four of us were working remotely, which did have its drawbacks, like time zones made it difficult, and part of the team lacked consistency in their communication with the others, and was barely available for team meets and mentor sessions. In fact, only two of the four were consistent, which had a negative effect on our work and the team morale.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h2>Future Possibilities</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Interactive or Immersive Experience</strong><br>
    With more time and technical support, the Open Door Project could evolve into an immersive installation, perhaps using motion, sound, or AR, like interactive posters, or where people literally walk through stories and experiences of access and equity.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Community Involvement</strong><br>
    Partnering with communities to co-design the Open Doors project with even more depth, where each community would develop and each would represent a unique story, and upon which they would expand the project’s cultural depth and authenticity. These could then be digitally showcased or installed in real-world environments.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Educational or Advocacy Tool</strong><br>
    The Open Door Project could become a digital platform that supports educators, policymakers, and advocates working in accessibility. This might include resources, lived-experience stories, and pathways for action.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Integration with Other Kaupapa</strong><br>
    The idea of “open doors” can easily align with mental health, prison reintegration, disability services, or housing advocacy, creating endless opportunities for impact across sectors.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    The Open Door Project has laid the foundation for something powerful and emotive.<br>
    While not everything went as planned, the heart was always present, our kaupapa remains intact, and the vision is strong. With future refinement, testing, and deeper community engagement, this project could grow into a truly transformative piece of design activism.<br>
    Though our team had its foundational issues, we did submit our project on time and completed it to a high standard.
