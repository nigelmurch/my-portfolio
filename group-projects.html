    <h1>OPEN DOOR PROJECT</h1>

    <h2>WHAT WENT RIGHT</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The core idea of accessibility and inclusion through the metaphor of a "door" was strong, universal, and relatable.</li>
      <li>Our team operated with a genuine heart. Everyone brought something unique to the table — whether that was visual design, research, storytelling, or cultural insight.</li>
      <li>The design process moved well through paper prototypes, lo-fi sketches, and found a more developed visual language.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>WHAT WENT WRONG</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The visuals didn’t fully match the emotional weight of the story we were trying to tell.</li>
      <li>Some elements of the project were rushed. The refinement stage felt squeezed in my opinion.</li>
      <li>We didn’t conduct enough real-world or community-based testing to validate our design decisions.</li>
      <li>There were inconsistencies or vagueness around some messaging, including tone and hierarchy.</li>
      <li>Remote teamwork introduced communication gaps that impacted alignment and clarity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FUTURE POSSIBILITIES</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Immersive installations using motion, sound, or AR posters to deepen user engagement.</li>
      <li>Co-designing with communities so each story evolves with authentic representation.</li>
      <li>Turning it into a digital platform that supports education, resources, and lived-experience advocacy.</li>
      <li>Broader accessibility themes could tie into mental health, justice, public services or housing equity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>
    <p>
      While not everything went as planned, the heart was there. The Open Door Project could grow into a truly transformative piece of design activism. 
      Our team laid a strong foundation for future work rooted in community engagement, collaboration and inclusive design.
