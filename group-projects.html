  <h2>What Went Right</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Strong Conceptual Foundation</strong><br>
    The core idea of accessibility and inclusion through the symbol of a “door” was strong, universal, and relatable. It resonated with people from a range of backgrounds and allowed us to ground the design in real social impact.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Team Collaboration & Contribution</strong><br>
    Our team operated with a genuine heart. Everyone brought something unique to the table, whether that was visual design, research, storytelling, or cultural insight.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lo-fi to Hi-fi Progression</strong><br>
    The design process moved well through paper prototypes, lo-fi sketches, and toward a more developed visual language. We were able to test layouts and flows, getting a clearer sense of how the experience would function in real life.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Clarity of Visual Purpose</strong><br>
    While the concept was strong, there were moments where the visuals didn’t fully match the emotional weight of the story we were trying to tell. Some early designs lacked cohesion, and our symbolism didn’t always translate clearly to viewers.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Limited Iteration Time</strong><br>
    Due to time constraints, some elements of the project were rushed. The refinement stage — where we could have polished animations, interactions, or typographic hierarchy — felt a bit squeezed, in my opinion. This meant we didn’t fully realise the depth and clarity that the project deserved.
    </li>
    <li><strong>User Testing Gaps</strong><br>
    We didn’t conduct as much real-world or community-based user testing as we should have. This limited our ability to validate key design decisions and understand how they might work, and might land with actual users who face the issues we were addressing.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Content Planning</strong><br>
    There were inconsistencies or vagueness around some messaging, including what the “Open Door” offered practically versus symbolically. If we had aligned on tone, message hierarchy, and audience from the beginning, the design could have carried more clarity and impact.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Group Presence and Communication</strong><br>
    All four of us were working remotely, which did have its drawbacks, like time zones made it difficult, and part of the team lacked consistency in their communication with the others, and was barely available for team meets and mentor sessions. In fact, only two of the four were consistent, which had a negative effect on our work and the team morale.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h2>Future Possibilities</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Interactive or Immersive Experience</strong><br>
    With more time and technical support, the Open Door Project could evolve into an immersive installation, perhaps using motion, sound, or AR, like interactive posters, or where people literally walk through stories and experiences of access and equity.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Community Involvement</strong><br>
    Partnering with communities to co-design the Open Doors project with even more depth, where each community would develop and each would represent a unique story, and upon which they would expand the project’s cultural depth and authenticity. These could then be digitally showcased or installed in real-world environments.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Educational or Advocacy Tool</strong><br>
    The Open Door Project could become a digital platform that supports educators, policymakers, and advocates working in accessibility. This might include resources, lived-experience stories, and pathways for action.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Integration with Other Kaupapa</strong><br>
    The idea of “open doors” can easily align with mental health, prison reintegration, disability services, or housing advocacy, creating endless opportunities for impact across sectors.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    The Open Door Project has laid the foundation for something powerful and emotive.<br>
    While not everything went as planned, the heart was always present, our kaupapa remains intact, and the vision is strong. With future refinement, testing, and deeper community engagement, this project could grow into a truly transformative piece of design activism.<br>
    Though our team had its foundational issues, we did submit our project on time and completed it to a high standard.

  <h2>What Went Right</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Culturally Grounded Design Framework</strong><br>
      From the outset, <em>Whetū Mārama</em> was guided by mātauranga Māori and a genuine desire to embed cultural values in every decision. The concept of illuminating hidden potential — like stars piercing darkness — helped ground the experience in hope, connection, and empowerment. It resonated strongly during critique and with peers from diverse backgrounds.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rich Storytelling and Symbolism</strong><br>
      Every element — from color palette to layout, animation timing to sound — was selected to support a narrative arc. Rather than just presenting facts, we let the experience unfold like a journey. Audiences appreciated the emotional depth and the poetic logic of the metaphors we used, including constellations, darkness and light, and navigation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Iterative Co-Design Process</strong><br>
      Our team embraced feedback loops. Peer reviews, user testing, and even late-stage critiques were taken seriously and used to refine both function and form. We weren’t afraid to scrap early ideas or rework visuals when something didn’t feel right. That iterative mindset helped us land on something more powerful than any one of us envisioned at the start.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr />

  <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Overambition and Feature Creep</strong><br>
      Our desire to include many interactive and symbolic layers meant that some features lacked polish. There were moments where simplicity would’ve delivered more clarity. We learned the hard way that "less, but better" often lands more impactfully.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Time Constraints and Visual Consistency</strong><br>
      As with many student projects, tight timelines meant visual cohesion suffered in places. Some assets (e.g., background elements, font pairings, or icon sizing) didn’t always meet our original design vision. Given more time, we would have harmonized the visuals to match the emotional tone we set.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accessibility Needs Not Fully Met</strong><br>
      Despite our intentions, we didn’t adequately build for full accessibility. Text contrast in certain sections, lack of screen reader support, and reliance on hover states are all areas we’d address if we revisited the project. Future iterations will consider WCAG compliance and inclusive design more proactively.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr />

  <h2>Future Possibilities</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Interactive Constellation Narratives</strong><br>
      Expand the symbolic star navigation idea into an interactive experience where users “travel” to different stars or stories. Each star could represent a rangatahi story or theme, deepening engagement through gamified storytelling.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Immersive Physical Exhibition</strong><br>
      Imagine Whetū Mārama as a dome or installation where projection, ambient sound, and guided reflection create a holistic immersive experience. This could travel across Aotearoa, connecting communities to the kaupapa in person.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Educational Outreach</strong><br>
      Partnering with kura or youth-focused organisations to bring the experience into schools, possibly through VR headsets or digital storytelling packs that link to wellbeing and identity.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr />

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    Whetū Mārama taught us to trust process, intuition, and kaupapa. It wasn’t always easy — time, polish, and accessibility were challenges — but the heart was always present.<br>
    We believe this project has the potential to evolve, to connect more deeply with more people, and to shine light where it's most needed. Like stars guiding travellers, we hope Whetū Mārama helps rangatahi find their way, their voice, and their light.
