    <p>Kia ora, I am Nigel Murch, I specialise in UX Research and I am also the founder of <strong>UX Investigator.</strong> <br>
      
      <p>Over the past three years, while pursuing my degree through Media Design School in Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand, I have committed myself to a singular mission: to uncover and understand what people truly need. I focus particularly on spaces where silence, stigma, or systemic barriers have made access unjustifiably difficult. 
   <br>As a UX researcher, I navigate the complex and often overlooked human side of design. My work involves identifying pain points and unspoken challenges and transforming them into clear, actionable insights. Whether co-designing with communities, interviewing rangatahi, or testing early concepts, my purpose remains constant — to amplify voices, bridge gaps, and champion inclusive innovation.</p>
    <p>I am guided by three unwavering principles:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Understand deeply</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Design with purpose</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Always advocate for the user</strong></li>
    </ul>
  <p>I am deeply committed to global equity and access — from sexual health to digital inclusion. I believe that when we lead with empathy and acknowledge people as the experts of their own lived experiences, we elevate design from merely functional to truly transformational.
    </p><p>My identity as a designer is shaped by a life well-lived, steeped in storytelling, deep listening, and collaborative change-making. I hail from Aotearoa, and my values are rooted in service, curiosity, and integrity.
    </p><p>My vision for the future is to contribute to bold, community-led projects that uplift lives — whether in healthcare, housing, public services, or digital platforms. I strive to bring truth to light through rigorous research, empower underrepresented voices, and support organisations in turning insight into real-world impact.
    </p><p>UX is not just my profession — it is my pathway to creating a fairer, more compassionate world, one meaningful experience at a time.
    </p>
