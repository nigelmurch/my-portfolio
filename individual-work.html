      This section showcases one my individual designs and research projects developed during my studies.I was proud to have developed a project that reflects a deep commitment to human-centered design, cultural relevance, and sustainable impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      From UX/UI prototypes to service design research and interactive storytelling, this project demonstrates my ability to empathize with users, integrate stakeholder insights, and deliver innovative digital solutions grounded in community needs and lived experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether exploring eco-conscious food systems, digital equity, or inclusive access to services, I take on contributes to a wider vision of equity, sustainability, and cultural respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I invite you to explore the portfolio with curiosity and a future-focused mindset, knowing these projects both individual and group works are just the beginning of a lifelong design journey with purpose and impact. Throughout this port follio you will see a side of my creativity that others may not have or embrace, I have developed this as my lived experience, one that is still growing, as we never stop learning, evry day is a new lesson, and I am ready for class.
