    </div>
    <div class="retro-modal-body">
<br><br>
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Te Pou Theatre approached us with a powerful challenge: to strengthen their presence as the heart of performing arts in West Auckland. 
        We saw the opportunity to redesign their website as a way to amplify their kaupapa, celebrate te ao Māori, and connect more deeply with the communities they serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Te Pou is more than a theatre – it’s a living, breathing space for te reo Māori, community storytelling, and indigenous creativity. 
        Our job wasn’t just to make a website; it was to reflect that mana (prestige, authority) online in a way that was functional, respectful, and visually powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        We took on the role of digital <em>kaitiaki</em> (guardians), ensuring the online presence matched the spirit and identity of Te Pou Theatre. 
        This meant respecting <em>tikanga</em> (customs), enhancing accessibility, and making sure the site would serve both the local community and wider audiences.
      </p>
<br><br>    
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>
        As a UX researcher and designer, I led the user research. I wanted every design decision to be grounded in real needs – from <em>kaimahi</em> (staff), to creatives, to regular attendees.
        I studied competing theatre websites and explored what made Te Pou’s kaupapa (purpose) stand out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created low-fidelity wireframes, guided content hierarchy, and helped shape the tone and voice of the website. 
        It needed to feel warm and grounded in te ao Māori, yet still usable for a broad audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked closely with our team — especially with Noah, our interactive designer. His Māori knowledge far surpassed my own, and he acted as our cultural bridge throughout the project.
      </p>
<br><br>
      <h3>The Design Process</h3>
      <p>
        We started with mood boards and competitor research to understand how other indigenous and creative organisations express themselves digitally. 
        A key insight emerged: many theatre websites feel cold or overly ticket-focused. But Te Pou’s strength is in its people and their stories — that needed to shine.
      </p>
      <p>We developed core user personas and journey maps for three audience groups:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whānau and community members wanting to know what’s on and how to attend</li>
        <li>Performers and artists looking for opportunities, rehearsal space, or funding pathways</li>
        <li>Organisational partners and funders seeking clarity on Te Pou’s impact and values</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We co-designed key pages — homepage, what’s on, kaupapa, and booking info — all tested against the question: 
        <strong>“Does this honour Te Pou’s wairua?”</strong>
      </p>
<br><br>
      <h3>Highlights & Wins</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cultural integrity upheld:</strong> <br>Our design respected <em>tikanga Māori</em>, using authentic colour, imagery, and type choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear structure, warm tone:</strong> <br> balanced intuitive navigation with a welcoming, mana-enhancing voice.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility-first:</strong> <br> contrast, font choices, and alt text were part of our design system from the beginning.</li>
      </ul>
<br><br>      <h3>What I’d Improve</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>More whānau testing:</strong> <br> didn’t have time for a full usability round with the community — a priority for future iterations.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic content:</strong> <br> love to integrate behind-the-scenes videos or audio stories to bring the site to life.</li>
        <li><strong>Bilingual UX:</strong> <br> used some te reo Māori, but a fuller dual-language experience would better reflect our goals of language revitalisation.</li>
      </ul>
<br><br>      <h3>Future Potential</h3>
      <p>
        This project is just the beginning. Te Pou’s site could grow into a digital <em>marae</em> — a space for gathering, learning, and connection.
        Ideas for future development include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <em>wānanga</em> space for artists and writers</li>
        <li>A community noticeboard</li>
        <li>Backend tools for <em>kaimahi</em> to manage shows, bookings, and events more easily</li>
      </ul>
<br><br>      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        This project meant a lot to me personally. As someone reconnecting with their whakapapa and cultural identity, being trusted to work on a kaupapa Māori project like this was both a privilege and a responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        It reminded me that design isn’t just about screens and pixels — it’s about people, stories, and legacy. 
        Te Pou Theatre has the potential to become a digital beacon for Māori performing arts. I’m proud of the foundation we laid — and excited for what’s ahead.
