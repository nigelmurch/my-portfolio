        Project Overview

Te Pou Theatre approached us with a powerful challenge:
 Help strengthen their presence as the heart of performing arts in West Auckland. 
We saw the opportunity to redesign their website as a way to amplify their kaupapa, celebrate te ao Māori, and connect more deeply with the communities they serve. 

Te Pou is more than a theatre – it’s a living, breathing space for te reo Māori, community storytelling, and indigenous creativity. Our job wasn’t just to make a website; it was to reflect that mana (prestige, authority) online in a way that was functional, respectful, and visually powerful.

We took on the role of digital kaitiaki (guardians), ensuring the online presence matched the spirit and identity of Te Pou Theatre. This meant respecting tikanga (customs), enhancing accessibility, and making sure the site would serve both the local community and wider audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       My Role
As a UX researcher and designer, I led the user research. I wanted every design decision to be grounded in real needs – from kaimahi (staff), to creatives, to regular attendees. I looked into competing theatre websites and explored what made Te Pou’s kaupapa (purpose) stand out.

I also created low-fidelity wireframes, guided content hierarchy, and helped shape the tone and voice of the website. It needed to feel warm and grounded in te ao Māori, yet still usable for a broad audience. I had many conversations with our team and especially the other Interactive designer, Noah, as his Maori knowledge by far superceded my own; he was our bridge between us, the design team and the cultural values we needed to uphold.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Design Process
We started with mood boards and competitor research, looking at how other indigenous and creative organisations expressed themselves digitally. The key insight? Many theatre websites feel cold or ticket-focused, but Te Pou’s heart is its people and the stories they share. That needed to come first.

We developed core user personas and journey maps, with clear distinctions between the needs of:
	•	Whānau/community wanting to know what’s on and how to attend
	•	Performers and artists looking for opportunities, rehearsal space, or funding pathways
	•	Organisational partners and funders seeking clarity on Te Pou’s impact and values

We then co-designed key pages: the homepage, what’s on, kaupapa, and booking info. Everything was tested against one question: “Does this honour Te Pou’s wairua?”
      </p>
      <p>
       Highlights & Wins
	•	Cultural integrity upheld: Our design choices were informed by tikanga Māori, and we used colour, imagery, and typography that reflected Te Ao Māori without slipping into tokenism.
	•	Clear structure, warm tone: We struck a balance between intuitive navigation and a tone that felt welcoming, whānau-oriented, and mana-enhancing.
	•	Accessibility first: From colour contrast to font choices and alt text, accessibility wasn’t an afterthought – it was baked into the design system from day one.

      </p>
      <p>
        What I’d Improve
	•	More whānau testing: Time constraints meant we didn’t run a full round of usability testing with community members. In future, I’d prioritise a feedback loop with actual Te Pou users.
	•	Dynamic content: The initial concept was static. I’d love to explore how we could make the site feel alive, like integrating short behind-the-scenes videos or audio snippets from shows.
	•	Bilingual UX: While we included some te reo Māori, a fuller dual-language experience would take the design to the next level and truly support the kaupapa of language revitalisation.
      <p>
        Future Potential
This project is just the start. Te Pou’s online presence can evolve into a digital marae – a place of gathering, learning, and connection. Future iterations could include:
	•	A wānanga space online for artists and writers
	•	A community noticeboard
	•	Better backend tools for kaimahi to manage shows, bookings, and events with ease

      </p>   
    <p>
        Final Thoughts
This project meant a lot to me personally. As someone on a journey of reconnecting with my own whakapapa and cultural identity, being trusted to work on a kaupapa Māori project like this was both a privilege and a responsibility. It was a reminder that design isn’t just about screens and pixels — it’s about people, stories, and legacy.

Te Pou Theatre has the potential to be a digital beacon for Māori performing arts. I’m proud of the foundation we laid, and I know there’s more beautiful work to come.
