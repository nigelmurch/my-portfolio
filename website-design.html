        <h3>Service Design Purpose</h3>
        <p><strong>Flavours By Papatūānuku</strong> is an eco-conscious food design service that connects people to wild and invasive foods as a way to nourish communities and protect native ecosystems through ethical eating.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Environmental Guardianship:</strong> eating invasive species helps restore balance.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Design Insight</h3>
        <p><strong>Flavours By Papatūānuku</strong> is rooted in the idea that food change requires more than facts—it requires emotion and identity.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Psychology of Eating:</strong> Many avoid wild foods due to food neophobia (fear from childhood).</li>
          <li><strong>Decolonisation Through Kai:</strong> Restoring cultural relationships by reconnecting people with whenua and whakapapa.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Why I Am Passionate About Flavours by Papatūānuku</h3>
      <p><strong>Flavours by Papatūānuku</strong> is more than just a project. It is a reflection of who I am, what I value, and the kind of future I want to help create. As someone with a deep connection to both the natural world and the people of Aotearoa, I feel a personal and cultural responsibility to protect and celebrate our environment.</p>
      <p>This project combines my passions for sustainability, design, storytelling, and social change. At its heart, it is about restoring balance and reimagining our relationship with food—not as passive consumers, but as active kaitiaki (guardians) of the whenua (land).</p>
      <p>By encouraging people to incorporate wild and invasive species into their diets, this project transforms an environmental problem into a cultural opportunity for reconnection, resilience, and innovation.</p>
      <p>I believe food is one of the most powerful tools to bring people together, spark conversation, and drive change. Every recipe, story, and interaction through Flavours by Papatūānuku is designed to educate, empower, and excite people about the possibility of living more lightly and consciously on the land—while also fostering financial stability and reducing waste.</p>
      <p>This project is a wero (challenge) to all of us: to think critically about the impact of our choices, to celebrate the gifts of Papatūānuku, and to imagine a future where sustainability isn’t a compromise—it’s a joy.</p>
