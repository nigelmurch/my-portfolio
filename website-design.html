      <h2>Open Door Project</h2>
      <h3>What Went Right</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The core idea of accessibility and inclusion through the metaphor of a "door" was strong, universal, and relatable.</li>
        <li>Our team operated with a genuine heart. Everyone brought something unique to the table — whether that was visual design, research, storytelling, or cultural insight.</li>
        <li>The design process moved well through paper prototypes, lo-fi sketches, and found a more developed visual language.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>What Went Wrong</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The visuals didn’t fully match the emotional weight of the story we were trying to tell.</li>
        <li>Some elements of the project were rushed. The refinement stage felt squeezed.</li>
        <li>We didn’t conduct enough real-world or community-based testing to validate our design decisions.</li>
        <li>There were inconsistencies or vagueness around some messaging, including tone and hierarchy.</li>
        <li>Remote teamwork introduced communication gaps that impacted alignment and clarity.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Future Possibilities</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Immersive installations using motion, sound, or AR posters to deepen user engagement.</li>
        <li>Co-designing with communities so each story evolves with authentic representation.</li>
        <li>Turning it into a digital platform that supports education, resources, and lived-experience advocacy.</li>
        <li>Broader accessibility themes could tie into mental health, justice, public services or housing equity.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>The Open Door Project could grow into a truly transformative piece of design activism. Our team laid a strong foundation for future work rooted in community engagement and inclusive design.</p>

  <!-- Whetu Marama Modal -->
  <div id="modalWhetu" class="modal-container">

      <h2>Whetū Mārama</h2>
      <h3>What Went Right</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The concept of Whetū Mārama as a guiding light was powerful and resonated with themes of whakapapa, resilience, and identity.</li>
        <li>We anchored our design in te ao Māori values, which gave the work a strong cultural foundation and sense of purpose.</li>
        <li>The visual direction — inspired by retro-futurism — was bold, unique, and gave the project a distinct personality.</li>
        <li>Our team collaborated well across disciplines, blending design, storytelling, and research into a cohesive whole.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>What Went Wrong</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Some of the symbolic and cultural references may not have been clearly communicated to broader audiences unfamiliar with the kaupapa.</li>
        <li>The audio and animation elements were ambitious, and some were only partially realised due to time constraints.</li>
        <li>There were moments where we drifted too far into aesthetics and needed to pull back to reinforce clarity of message.</li>
        <li>User testing was limited, especially with intergenerational or kaumātua voices that could have strengthened the direction.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Future Possibilities</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Expanding Whetū Mārama into a cross-platform storyworld, including animation, interactive storytelling, or game-based learning tools.</li>
        <li>Deeper partnerships with iwi or cultural advisors to co-create future content and ensure rich authenticity.</li>
        <li>Creating a physical installation or night-time light experience where stories are projected onto real spaces.</li>
        <li>Translating the narrative into education modules to be used in kura kaupapa and mainstream schools alike.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>Whetū Mārama brought together creativity, cultural respect, and futuristic vision in a way that felt truly meaningful. While the project isn’t perfect, it has the spark of something greater — a potential taonga for future storytelling in Aotearoa.</p>
